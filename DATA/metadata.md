Data Summary:<br>
- This data set shows the annual data on the average price of electricity to consumers from 2000-2025. It contains each US state and DC’s average price per year for residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors. The price is in cents per kilowatt hour. We were able to pull these specific years from the Energy Information Administration’s API [1].

Provenance:<br>
- This data set is put together by the Office of Energy Production, Conversion & Delivery, Energy Information Administration, and the U.S. Department of Energy. The data comes from several Energy Information Administration forms that were combined to be pulled by the API.

License:<br>
- This data has an open license, so the data can be used with few restrictions.

Ethical Statements:<br>
- For this project we relied on data that was collected from the Energy Information Administration which is a division of the US Department of Energy. This data has an open license and is free to be used by the public given it is government data, so there is no risk of us misusing or reproducing someone else’s data without proper permissions or licenses. Given its nature of electricity prices for entire states there is no risk to the privacy of any person.
