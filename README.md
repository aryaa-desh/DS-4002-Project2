# DS-4002-Project2
This contains the material for DS 4002 Project 2

## Section 1: Software and Platform Selection
We used the Python language for all analysis and it was run on a local enviroment through Anacdonda and the code was wrote in VS code.
For additional software we imported the python packages pandas, transformers, and json.
We used Windows as our platform.

#### Section 3: Instructions for Reproducing Results
1. Navigate to the DATA folder and download the file Average_retail_price_of_electrcity (2) (1).csv
2. Upload data into whatever enviroment you use (e.g. Google Colab or VS Code)
3. After uploading the file, navigate to the SCRIPTS folder and upload the Data_preprocessing.ipynb file to the enviroment as well.
4. With both the script and data uploaded, run the script to do the data pre-processing
5. After running the scripts file, you will then have created a pre-processed file similar to preprocessed_data.csv
6. After this, navigate once again to SCRIPTS folder
7. There you will find the file called P2_modeltesting.ipynb, put this into your enviroment and run it
8. Once again navigate to the SCRIPTS folder and upload the P2_EDA2.ipynb, run it as well.
9. Once again navigate to SCRIPTS and also run P2_analysis4.ipynb in the same enviroment as all previous scripts
10. Navigate to SCRIPTS for the last time and run 2022_2025_graph5.ipynb to create graphs to visualize the data
